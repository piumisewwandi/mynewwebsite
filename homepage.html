            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka, a tropical island nestled in the Indian Ocean, is home to a diverse and thriving turtle population. With its pristine beaches and abundant coastal ecosystems, this enchanting island serves as a crucial nesting ground and haven for several turtle species.</p>
               <ol>
                <li>The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)</li>
                <li>The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)</li>
                <li>The Loggerhead Turtle (Caretta caretta)</li>
                <li>The Olive Ridley Turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)</li>
                <li>The Leatherback Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)</li>
               </ol>
            
                <br><br><p> During the nesting season, which typically occurs between November and April, Sri Lanka's beaches witness a remarkable phenomenon as female turtles emerge from the depths of the ocean to lay their eggs. Each species exhibits unique nesting behaviors and preferences, with some turtles returning to the same beach where they hatched years ago.Conservation efforts in Sri Lanka have recognized the importance of protecting these nesting sites and implementing measures to ensure the survival of turtle populations. Local organizations, government initiatives, and community-based conservation projects work tirelessly to safeguard these fragile habitats, combat poaching, and educate the public about the importance of turtle conservation. <br><br>
                Sri Lanka's commitment to preserving its turtle population is showcased through numerous initiatives, such as the establishment of turtle hatcheries along the coastline. These hatcheries rescue eggs from vulnerable nesting sites, protecting them from natural predators and human interference. Once the hatchlings emerge, they are carefully released into the ocean, increasing their chances of survival and contributing to the growth of the turtle population. <br> <br>
                Turtle conservation in Sri Lanka also extends beyond the nesting beaches. The island's rich marine ecosystems provide ample feeding grounds for turtles, offering them a diverse diet of seagrasses, algae, jellyfish, and other marine organisms. These habitats are crucial for the long-term survival and well-being of the turtles, making efforts to preserve and restore these ecosystems vital.</p>

                        <p>Olive Ridley turtles have been coming ashore at a stretch of naturally formed beach near Galle Face to lay eggs. The Open University <sup>'</sup> s senior zoology lecturer, Dr Saminda Fernando, said the sighting of the species, Lepidochelys olivacea, had dropped during the construction of the port city when sand was dredged.
                        But now a natural sandy area has formed near the area where the Beira Lake opens up to the sea.</p>

                        <p>On the south coast of Sri Lanka, turtles have laid their eggs for generations.  Swimming in from the Indian Ocean, they drag themselves up the sand on the beaches near the city of Galle and dig their nests, where they leave the eggs.
                        Turtles usually lay more than a hundred eggs, so enough make it through to keep the species going. The rest become food for predators, which helps those species survive.</p>
