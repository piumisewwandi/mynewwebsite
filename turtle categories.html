        <h2 id="1">Green Turtle</h2>
        <p>The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) is one of the most common species of turtles found in Sri Lanka. Green turtles inhabit both coastal and offshore waters, including seagrass meadows and coral reefs. They nest on sandy beaches in Sri Lanka. 
        <br><br> Green turtles hold a special place in Sri Lanka's coastal ecosystems. Known for their strong site fidelity, they often return to the same beaches where they hatched to nest as adults. The nesting process is a slow and deliberate affair, with the female carefully selecting a suitable spot and digging a nest chamber with her rear flippers. These turtles play a vital role in maintaining the health of seagrass meadows, as they graze on the abundant seagrass beds. However, they face multiple threats, including entanglement in fishing gear, consumption of marine debris, and habitat destruction. Conservation initiatives in Sri Lanka involve monitoring nesting populations, protecting nesting habitats, and raising awareness among coastal communities about sustainable fishing practices and the importance of sea turtle conservation.
        <br><br> Green turtles are herbivores, primarily feeding on seagrasses and algae. They play a crucial role in maintaining the health of seagrass ecosystems.</p>

        <p>Loggerhead turtles are typically found in open ocean habitats and coastal waters, including seagrass beds and coral reefs. They nest on sandy beaches.  Loggerhead turtles nest in a solitary manner, often making multiple nest attempts in a nesting season. They lay around 100-120 eggs per clutch. 
        <br><br> Loggerhead turtles are known for their robust build and powerful jaws, perfectly adapted for their diet of bottom-dwelling prey. They undertake solitary nesting behavior, with females making multiple nesting attempts during a season. The nesting process involves digging a deep nest cavity and carefully laying their eggs before returning to the ocean. Loggerhead turtles occupy a broad range of coastal habitats and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. However, they face significant threats such as accidental capture in fishing gear, coastal development, and pollution. Conservation efforts in Sri Lanka focus on protecting nesting beaches, implementing turtle-friendly fishing practices, and engaging local communities in conservation efforts.
        <br><br>  Research and monitoring programs help gather valuable data on nesting populations and migration patterns, contributing to the understanding of loggerhead turtle ecology and informing conservation strategies. </p>

        <br><br> Olive Ridley turtles are fascinating creatures that exhibit unique nesting behavior. During an arribada, thousands of females simultaneously come ashore to nest, creating an awe-inspiring sight. The nesting process involves the female digging a nest with her flippers and laying eggs before covering them with sand. These turtles have a remarkable ability to navigate long distances, undertaking extensive migrations across the ocean. However, they face significant threats, such as incidental capture in fishing gear and habitat degradation due to coastal development.

        <br><br> Hawksbill turtles possess unique beauty and ecological significance. Their exquisite nesting behavior often takes place in rocky areas or coral reefs, presenting challenges for researchers and conservationists. The female carefully selects a suitable site and lays her eggs in a chamber hidden within the rocky terrain. Hawksbill turtles are renowned for their strikingly beautiful shells, which have long been sought after for their intricate patterns. Unfortunately, this has led to a decline in their populations due to poaching for their shells. Conservation efforts in Sri Lanka focus on protecting nesting habitats, combating illegal trade, promoting sustainable tourism practices, and enhancing public awareness to safeguard these critically endangered turtles.</p>

        <br><br> Leatherback turtles are truly remarkable creatures and hold the title for being the largest sea turtles in the world. Their unique nesting habits involve nesting at night, and they excavate deep nests compared to other turtle species. The leatherback's shell is unique among turtles, consisting of a leathery, flexible carapace covered with ridges. Their large size and distinct adaptations, such as heat-retaining dark skin and specialized feeding structures, enable them to navigate the open ocean and dive to great depths in search of their jellyfish prey. Leatherback turtles face numerous threats, including accidental entanglement in fishing gear, ingestion of marine debris, and habitat degradation. 
        <br><br>Conservation initiatives in Sri Lanka aim to protect their nesting sites, promote responsible fishing practices, and raise awareness about reducing plastic pollution to ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures.</p>
